			<section>Just like Mysore, Srirangapatna has a royal past, which presents itself before tourists in a stylish way. Throughout its history, it has served as the historical capital of various kings and dynasties, including Hyder Ali and his son Tipu Sultan. It is located just 16 km from Mysore, another famous place to visit in Karnataka, and is blessed with an incredibly rich cultural heritage. The town is dotted with structures like the Dariya Daulat Palace, which attests to his daring might and courage, with which he defeated the British in several battles. Then there is the Tipu Sultan Fort, whose walls depict the valour and gallantry of Tipu. The sightseeing opportunities do not end with just the historical structures, as there are places of natural beauty too.</section>
