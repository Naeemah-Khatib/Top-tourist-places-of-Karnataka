			<section>The town of Gokarna would have been just another sleepy little town, just like so many others in Karnataka, had it not been for Gokarna Beach. Fondly called the OM Beach, as it resembles the religious Hindu symbol OM, it is a picture of undisturbed serenity. The shoreline of this famous beach in Karnataka, stretches all the way until it meets a rocky cliff, as is the case with several other beaches here. It is connected to other beaches via a boat ride, apart from walking. Boating is looked forward to enthusiastically, as are banana boat rides. Most of all though, it is dolphin spotting which promises to make your day.nd plenty of other opportunities for having a great time.</section>
