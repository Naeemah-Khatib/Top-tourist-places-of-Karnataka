			<section>Bijapur is great for those who love exploring historical sites, for it is dotted with several of them. Although it is known as Bijapur today, there was a time when it was known as Vijajpura. The city was formed by the Kalyani Chalukyas during the 10-11th centuries, followed by Yadavas, and then by the Bahmani Sultanate. It was during the latterâ€™s reign that most of the tourist attractions like Bijapur Fort, Jama Masjid and Gol Gumbaz, were built. Although there are several mausoleums, mosques and watchtowers, it is the Gol Gumbaz which stands like a giant among others, always managing to impress visitors with its aesthetic and proportions.</section>
