			<section>Jog Falls is formed when River Sharavathy descends ferociously from an incredible height of almost 253 meters. It is the second highest plunge waterfall in Asia and should be visited during the monsoon to watch it in all its magnificence. The river swells up during the monsoons as a result of the Linganamakki Dam releasing excess water. The best part about visiting the Jog Falls in Karnataka is the opportunity to see it up close. A series of steps, numbering almost 1000, take you to the base of the falls. Watch it from a distance though, and the Jog Falls look like they were falling from the skies and forming a thick mist as they land, as if drawing attention of the onlookers to their intensity and uncontrolled rage.</section>
