			<section>Coorg of Kodagu is one of the most beautiful places to visit in Karnataka. You should visit this place for its coffee plantations and its distinct culture. Topographically, it enjoys a high altitude, and is spread out leisurely on the eastern slopes of the Western Ghats. The richness in its culture is also reflected in its wildlife, as it boasts three wildlife sanctuaries and a famous national park in India called Nagarhole National Park, nowadays popularly known as Rajiv Gandhi National Park. Checking out the traditional costume, known as “kupaya”, is as exciting as trying out the native dishes, kadumbuttu and pandi curry. If the waterfalls don’t interest you, maybe the temples will. If both of them don’t, then you can always explore the coffee plantation and take in the beauty of the countryside.
