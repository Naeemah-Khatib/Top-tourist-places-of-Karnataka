			<section>For lack of a better word, we should refer to it as the ruins of Hampi. This was once a prosperous city, abundant in riches of all kinds. It is from the writings of various travellers over the ages, from Ibn Battuta to Fernao Nunes, that we are acquainted with its immense power and wealth. Today, Hampi stands as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, still managing to evoke surprise and admiration from visitors. While exploring the temples, elephants stables, chariots, bazaar streets and other parts of the ruins, various images of prosperity and opulence appear in your mind. You could visit Hampi as a solo traveller, or with your family. A backpacking trip here will give you a lot to talk about.</section>
